Lab 1:
For Lab 1 I tried to do as much as I could on my own before looking at the videos. For the first video or two I just looked at the videos in the beginning.
But for the last two exercises I did as much as I could before looking at the videos. I found the exercise on the forms very useful. I wish the semantics of HTML had been explained better.

### Accessibility

For Lab 2 I found it very useful for the assignments. I completed the lab a long time ago but I'm just doing the reflection now. At first I had some trouble getting used to the accessibility audits but after a while I found them helpful because at times I would forget to add a legend to a fieldset or other things of that nature.
