### HTML

Lab 1:
For Lab 1 I tried to do as much as I could on my own before looking at the videos. For the first video or two I just looked at the videos in the beginning.
But for the last two exercises I did as much as I could before looking at the videos. I found the exercise on the forms very useful. I wish the semantics of HTML had been explained better. I don't think there was anything I wished to be explained better. I don't think there were any other exercises that would've helped me.

### Accessibility

Enter your reflections on this section here.

For Lab 2 I found it very useful for the assignments. I completed the lab a long time ago but I'm just doing the reflection now. At first I had some trouble getting used to the accessibility audits but after a while I found them helpful because at times I would forget to add a legend to a fieldset or other things of that nature. I don't think there was anything I wished to be explained better. I don't think there were any other exercises that would've helped me.

### CSS

For Lab 3 I found this one more difficult than the others. The videos were very helpful but I found myself struggling with the last two videos especially. I took a web development class a long time ago so this is somewhat familiar thankfully. I used the videos for this lab. I don't think there was anything I wished to be explained better. I don't think there were any other exercises that would've helped me.

### Flexbox

For Lab 4 I found it pretty straight forward and easy. I don't believe I've worked with them before but I found it quite simple to understand. I used the videos for this lab. I don't think there was anything I wished to be explained better. I don't think there were any other exercises that would've helped me.

### Grids

For Lab 5 I also found this lab simple and pretty easy. I think it's very useful to know this information but I found it somewhat similar to the last lab about flexbox. CSS is starting to make more sense the more I work on these labs. I used the videos for this lab. I don't think there was anything I wished to be explained better. I don't think there were any other exercises that would've helped me.

### Bootstrap

For Lab 6 I used the videos. I found them very useful. I don't think there was anything I wished to be explained better. I don't think there were any other exercises that would've helped me.
